# Closures

A closure or anonymous function in Go is a function value that references variables from outside its body. It "encloses" the variables in its lexical scope, allowing it to access and manipulate these variables even after the enclosing function has finished execution. This enables functions to maintain state across multiple invocations.

It enables functional programming paradigms and enhance the code expressiveness. They provide a way to create functions with persistent state, improving the flexibility and maintainability of your code.
